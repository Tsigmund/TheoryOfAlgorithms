Problem #1:
	The whole program is in FIFO.cpp. 
	Run with the c++ compiler of your choice. I used g++ in a linux(ubuntu) terminal interface.

	See SampleRunFIFO.txt for sample input/output.

Problem #2:
	Code is in process.cpp. Run with c++ compiler (same as #1). 

	Sample text files from output are included (c1fileSAMPLE, c2fileSAMPLE, PfileSAMPLE).
