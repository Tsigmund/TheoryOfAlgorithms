Clustering problem for 3D and 4D objects (n <= 50,000)

Find shapes of contiguous clusters.

Members: Latitude (degrees), longitude (deg), velocity, brightness (radiotemperature)

Implemented in Python.

General specifications:

  1. Look into methods to group the points.  

  2. Automatically define a region (2D, 3D, ND)  that encompasses the points in a reasonable way
  (Ex: sphere, tube, sheet, hypercube, etc.)
